# asteroids
A code repository for my version of the game Asteroids. All art assets (not including sfx) included are original and made by me

The game is not a complete or polished game. It is a very simple prototype. There is no menu system. 

Controls: 
Thrust: Press "Space" key to move your ship forward in the direction it is facing
Rotate: Use the "<-" & "->" arrow keys to rotate your ship clockwise or anticlockwise
Shoot: Press "Control" key to shoot bullets that can destroy asteroids
